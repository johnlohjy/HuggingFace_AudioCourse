    "The ```load_dataset``` function downloads audio examples with the sampling rate that they were published with. This is not always the sampling rate expected by a model you plan to train, or use for inference. If there’s a discrepancy between the sampling rates, you can resample the audio to the model’s expected sampling rate.\n",

    "To do so, use HuggingFace Datasets’ ```cast_column``` method. This operation does not change the audio in-place, but rather signals to datasets to resample the audio examples on the fly when they are loaded. The following code will set the sampling rate to 16kHz"
